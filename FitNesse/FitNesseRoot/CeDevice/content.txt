!1 Updating Tests
Before starting work update to the latest version of the Test Suite at [[CE-Fitnesse][http://172.20.124.72:8080/CeDeviceTests]]. This is done via Tools > [[Properties][/CeDevice?properties]] using '''Wiki Import Update > Update Subpages'''. After Importing if there are Suites currently not relevant to the feature being worked on then delete those pages manually in !-FitnesseRoot-! (on your file system)
